# trace-reconstruction
The name of this research is trace reconstruction. Namely, we recover the original sequence by using a number of traces. 

The research involves Theory of Probability, Sterling's Formula, Hoeffding's Inequality, and many other applications of math.

There are two sets of code(exponential and polynomial) that allow us to recover the original string. 

Trace reconstruction can be used in the bio industry, telecommunicating industry and so on.
